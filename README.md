# Energy Risk Scenario Analysis

Initial infrastructure for a quantitative project on energy price risk using structural VAR (SVAR) models.

The project focuses on a representative European airline as an industrial case study, with the objective of translating macro-energy shocks into fuel-cost risk and scenario-based decision support.

Current stage: project setup and codebase initialization.
