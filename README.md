# Energy Risk Scenario Analysis

This repository provides the initial infrastructure for a quantitative project on energy price risk using structural VAR (SVAR) models.

The project focuses on a representative European airline as an industrial case study, with the objective of analyzing how different macro-energy shocks (supply, aggregate demand, precautionary demand) translate into fuel-cost risk and decision-relevant scenarios.

Current stage: project setup and codebase initialization.
