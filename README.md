# Energy Risk Scenario Analysis

## Project status

This project is currently **archived** and no longer under active development.

It represents a completed research pipeline focused on structural oil-market
analysis and energy price risk, developed as part of previous academic work.

Further development is intentionally paused, as ongoing research efforts
have shifted toward corporate macro stress testing and decision-oriented
risk analysis.
##

Initial infrastructure for a quantitative project on energy price risk using structural VAR (SVAR) models.

The project focuses on a representative European airline as an industrial case study, with the objective of translating macro-energy shocks into fuel-cost risk and scenario-based decision support.

Current stage: project setup and codebase initialization.
